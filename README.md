# Final-Project

This project will use Pong Chu's vanilla system to implement a crash detection system using the Nexys DDR4 FPGA board. The on-board accelerometer will be used to collect data on the board's motion, and any rapid deceleration will trigger the crash detection mechanism. When a crash is detected, the board's LED's will begin to flash rapidly.
