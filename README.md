# Final-Project

This project uses Pong Chu's vanilla system to implement a crash detection system using the Nexys DDR4 FPGA board. The on-board accelerometer is used to collect data on the board's motion, and any rapid deceleration (following detected freefall) triggers the crash detection mechanism. When a crash is detected, the board's LED's begin to flash rapidly before returning to the monitoring state.
